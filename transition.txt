Isolate the syntax editor from fault.io with the growth of the terminal device.

Originally dependent on fault.terminal as a graphics context adapter, the limitations and
inconsistencies among common terminal emulators made depending on ANSI/DEC escapes more
effort than writing the pixels. Latency being critical for a syntax editor, performance often suffered
with the additional layers of I/O, and scrolling performance suffered greatly as only a few
of the popular emulators supported copy instructions for simple cell region moves.

xterm being the standout among emulators, the only alternative to creating a new terminal was
to write the application, essentially, exclusively for xterm and allow performance to suffer on other
emulators. However, xterm is not always *easily* accessed. While implementing the terminal
device to support multiple platforms is expensive, it also offers advantages that will never likely
be commonly available among emulators with a consistent interface.
